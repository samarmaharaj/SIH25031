Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System

## Background

Local governments often face challenges in promptly identifying, prioritizing, and resolving everyday civic issues such as potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, or overflowing trash bins. Although citizens encounter these problems daily, the absence of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. A streamlined, mobile-first solution can bridge this gap by empowering community members to submit real-world reports that municipalities can systematically address.

## Detailed Description

This system centers on an intuitive mobile interface, enabling users to submit reports in real-time. Each report may include a photo, automatic location tagging, and a concise text or voice explanation, providing essential context. Submitted issues populate a centralized dashboard featuring a live, interactive map of the city's reported concerns. The system highlights priority areas based on submission volume, urgency inferred from user inputs, or other configurable criteria.

Administrators access a robust dashboard to view, filter, and categorize incoming reports. Automated routing directs each report to the appropriate department—such as sanitation or public works—based on issue type and location. The architecture is designed to handle spikes in reporting, ensuring fast image uploads, responsive performance across devices, and near real-time updates for both mobile and desktop clients.

## Expected Solution

The final deliverable should include a mobile platform supporting cross-device functionality and a seamless user experience. Citizens must be able to capture issues effortlessly, track the progress of their reports, and receive notifications at each stage: confirmation, acknowledgment, and resolution.

On the backend, a web-based administrative portal will enable municipal staff to filter issues by category, location, or priority, assign tasks, update statuses, and communicate progress. The platform should feature an automated routing engine that leverages report metadata to allocate tasks to the correct departments.

A scalable, resilient backend must manage high volumes of multimedia content, support concurrent users, and provide APIs for future integrations or extensions. Additionally, the solution should deliver analytics and reporting features that offer insights into reporting trends, departmental response times, and overall system effectiveness—ultimately driving better civic engagement and government accountability.
